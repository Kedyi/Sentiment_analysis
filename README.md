## OBJECTIVE
Create a system using Tweepy API and Textblob that will not require a dataset to perform sentiment analysis. With this system we will be able to draw a huge amount of tweets and parse it using python.

## About the System
In this project, I tried to propose and learn about a system that perform sentiment analysis with a more easier approach that does not require an existing dataset.
I have used my Twitter Developer profile with Tweepy API to access the tweets and use Textblob Library for processing textual data.

## ARCHITECTURE
- Twitter Database
- Tweepy API
- Sentiment Analyzer

###  TWITTER DATABASE:
Through twitter database we will be able to access the tweets being made.

### TWEEPY API:
Python Library which gives a convenient way to access Twitter API with its own set of classes and methods.

### SENTIMENT ANALYZER:
Performs sentiment analysis on the filtered tweets.

## REQUIREMENTS
- Python3
- Google Collab / Visual Studio Code 
- Tweepy API
- Twitter Developer Access
- Textblob

## MODULES
- Streaming the tweets
- Accessing the tweets
- Analyzing the tweets
- Visualizing the tweets
- Sentiment analysis

## RESULT
Was successfully able to stream, analyze, visualize the data. After completing the aforementioned steps I was
able to perform sentiment analysis successfully.
